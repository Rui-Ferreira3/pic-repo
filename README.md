The directury structure is:
- PiPico-projects has the hello world project and the FreeRTOS project that were used one the raspberry pi pico
- SweRVolf-projects has the assembly code and a directory with the programs that use Zephyr
    - Inside the Zpehyr directory there is the hello world using Zephyr and the philosophers problem using zephyr
